### Inspiration
We wanted to work with surgerical based items because of our mentors, we decided on a surgical tools video analyzer to achieve this

### What it does
Eyelight takes in a video with surgical tools and generates a report based on data from their appearance in the video

### How we built it
We started by connecting the database Firebase with python and React. Then when inputs from React are sent to our ML algorithnm. With those information, we make a report on React with these filled in data.

### Challenges we ran into
We spent the majority of our time interfacing based on our inexperience with React

Sometimes it was difficult seeing value in our work

There were disagreements based on what languages to use

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We wrote code separately and it worked when we connected everything together. We also utilized many different disciplines like databases, frontend, and backend

### What we learned
how to communicate between the frontend and backend
how to communicate the backend and frontend
how to start a project from scratch
how an agile based development works
how to learn from each other in seperate tasks

### What's next for Eyelight
Allow more videos to be uploaded
Make the frontend look better
Properly host the project onto a website
Implement login and logout
Use the database scalability

### Built With
Python
React
Firebase

__How to run it__
1. 2 terminals
2. One terminal gets into the folder and uses command "npm start"
3. Second terminal goes into the "back_endApi" folder and and uses command "python app.py"
4. The react screen will show up, go to the upload page and upload a video. The video that works for the demo is "demo_test" in "public/uploads"
5. When the preview shows up or doesn't, go to watch and play around with the video
